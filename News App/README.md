A news app which scrapes news articles from the BBC website, and then stores articles in an SQLITE3 database. 
It categorizes the articles using the tags BBC marks them under.

The news is then displayed in a Flutter app which allows the user to select different categories from a dropdown list.
Each article has a link which leads to the original article on the BBC page.

DISCLAIMER:
If in the future, BBC's HTML structure is changed, the web scraping might be unsuccessful.
